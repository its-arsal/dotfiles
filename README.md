# Welcome to my dotfiles repo

This repo contains config files for most of the stuff that I use on my system.

You can use them any way you want!

I have added screenshots of some of these, so that
you can see what they look like, before you start using them.

**Plus**, there's a [**spec sheet**](#spec-sheet) which lists
some of the programs and links to their website/repos.
